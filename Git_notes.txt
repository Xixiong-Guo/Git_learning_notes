git init  % add this directory to git repo

git add filename  % add the file to the repo
git commit -m "modification reason"  % officially commite to repo

git status % check the status of the file

git log %  (or git log --pretty=oneline)

git reset --hard HEAD^  %(HEAD IS CURRENT VERSION, HEAD^ LAST VERSION (OR HEAD~1))

git reset --hard commit_id % do not need full id, first few digits

git reglog % if we forget the commit_id, use it to check history


UNDERSTANDING HOW STAGE WORKS
Working directory and Stage (git add, all changes put in stage, before commit)
After all changes are added and commited, then git status: nothing to commit, working tree clean
